# Rhetoric

### Definition:
Persuasive speaking/writing used to strengthen an argument. While not inherently bad, it can be used manipulatively.

### Ways Rhetoric Can Manipulate:
1. **Euphemism**: Portray a positive image (*e.g., Murdered → Neutralized*)  
2. **Dysphemism**: Portray a negative image (*e.g., Pro-loved → Used*)  
3. **Weaslers**: Plant suggestions without claiming explicitly (*e.g., Save up to 40%*)  
4. **Downplaying**: Make something appear less significant (*e.g., so-called, mere*)  
5. **Stereotypes**: Cultural beliefs about social groups (*e.g., "Patwari" or "Moulvi"*)  
6. **Innuendo**: Imply without direct statements (*e.g., "I am proof that at least one candidate here has never taken a bribe."*)  
7. **Loaded Questions**: Frame questions to get a preferred answer  
8. **Ridicule**: Use humor/sarcasm to dismiss someone  
9. **Hyperbole**: Overstate a situation  
10. **Repetition**: Repeat a point multiple times  
11. **Proof Surrogate**: Claim support exists without providing evidence

4. **Definitions**: Misaligned or unclear definitions  

### Types of Definitions:
1. Lexical  
2. Stipulative  
3. Precision  
4. Rhetorical  
5. By Example  
6. By Synonym

# Ethics

## Deontology  
Actions are inherently good or bad.  

### How to Determine What Is Ethical:
1. State your desired action and its purpose.  
2. **Universalize**: Imagine a world where your action becomes a Law of Nature and everyone follows it.  
3. Check if you can still perform your action in that hypothetical world.  

---

## Consequentialism  
Actions are judged by their outcomes.  

### Categories:
1. **Altruism**: Happiness of others over self  
2. **Egoism**: Self-happiness  
3. **Utilitarianism**: Happiness of the greatest number
